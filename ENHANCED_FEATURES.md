# Enhanced Mist Database Engine Features

This document summarizes the enhanced features that have been implemented in the Mist database engine to support more complete SQL compatibility.

## Newly Implemented Features

### 1. DATE Type Support
- **Full DATE data type support** with proper parsing and validation
- Supports various date formats: `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY/MM/DD`, `MM/DD/YYYY`, etc.
- Automatic date format conversion to standard `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- Used in CREATE TABLE statements: `event_date DATE NOT NULL`

### 2. UNIQUE Key Constraints
- **UNIQUE constraint support** at both column level and table level
- Prevents duplicate values in unique columns
- Works with both `UNIQUE` keyword and `UNIQUE KEY` constraint syntax
- Maintains unique indexes for efficient duplicate detection
- Examples:
  ```sql
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE
  UNIQUE KEY unique_username (username)
  ```

### 3. ENUM Type Support
- **Full ENUM data type implementation** with value validation
- Stores allowed enum values and validates against them on insert/update
- Supports default enum values
- Proper error messages for invalid enum values
- Example:
  ```sql
  status ENUM('pending', 'processing', 'shipped', 'delivered') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending'
  ```

### 4. ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- **Automatic timestamp updates** on row modifications
- Columns with `ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` automatically get updated timestamps
- Only updates when the row is actually modified (not when explicitly setting the column)
- Works with UPDATE statements
- Example:
  ```sql
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  ```

### 5. FOREIGN KEY Constraints 
- **Complete foreign key constraint support** with full referential integrity
- **All standard foreign key actions implemented**:
  - `RESTRICT` (default) - Prevents deletion/update of referenced rows
  - `CASCADE` - Automatically deletes dependent rows
  - `SET NULL` - Sets foreign key columns to NULL (requires nullable columns)
  - `SET DEFAULT` - Sets foreign key columns to their default values (requires default values)
  - `NO ACTION` - Same as RESTRICT
- Validates foreign key relationships during INSERT and UPDATE operations
- Executes appropriate actions during DELETE operations
- Supports composite foreign keys (multiple columns)
- NULL values in foreign key columns are allowed (optional relationships)
- Comprehensive error handling for invalid action scenarios
- Examples:
  ```sql
  FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES companies(id)
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id, role_id) REFERENCES user_roles(user_id, role_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE RESTRICT
  FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES categories(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
  FOREIGN KEY (status_id) REFERENCES statuses(id) ON DELETE SET DEFAULT
  ```

### 6. GROUP BY with Aggregates
- **Full GROUP BY clause support** with aggregate functions
- Allows mixing non-aggregate columns (in GROUP BY) with aggregate functions
- Supports multiple GROUP BY columns
- Works with all aggregate functions: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX
- Proper validation ensuring non-aggregate columns appear in GROUP BY clause
- Example:
  ```sql
  SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count FROM invoices GROUP BY status
  SELECT department, position, AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department, position
  ```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Column Structure Enhancements
The `Column` struct has been enhanced with new fields:
- `Unique bool` - Indicates if column has unique constraint
- `OnUpdate interface{}` - Stores ON UPDATE trigger (e.g., CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
- `EnumValues []string` - Stores allowed values for ENUM columns
- `ForeignKey *ForeignKey` - Stores foreign key constraint information

### Foreign Key Constraint Management
- Tables maintain foreign key constraints as `[]ForeignKey`
- Each foreign key stores local columns, referenced table/columns, and actions
- **Two-phase deletion process**:
  1. Validation phase: Checks RESTRICT/NO ACTION constraints
  2. Action phase: Executes CASCADE/SET NULL/SET DEFAULT actions
- Supports recursive CASCADE deletions with proper dependency handling
- Comprehensive validation for action requirements (nullable columns, default values)
- Thread-safe operations with proper locking during multi-table modifications

### GROUP BY Processing
- Enhanced aggregate query processing to handle GROUP BY clauses
- Rows are grouped by GROUP BY column values using composite keys
- Separate processing for group columns vs. aggregate functions
- Proper validation of SELECT field requirements (must be in GROUP BY or aggregate)

### Unique Constraint Management
- Tables maintain unique indexes as `map[string]map[interface{}]bool`
- Duplicate detection happens during INSERT and UPDATE operations
- Primary key columns automatically get unique constraint treatment

### Date Handling
- Flexible date parsing supporting multiple input formats
- Consistent output format (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
- Proper validation and error handling for invalid dates

### ENUM Validation
- Compile-time extraction of ENUM values from SQL parser
- Runtime validation of values against allowed enum list
- Default value support using first enum value if not specified

## Compatibility Impact

### Before Enhancement
The original Mist engine required "compatible" SQL files that:
- Used `VARCHAR` instead of `ENUM`
- Used `VARCHAR(20)` instead of `DATE`
- Removed `UNIQUE` constraints
- Removed `ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` clauses
- Removed `FOREIGN KEY` constraints (still not supported)

### After Enhancement
The Mist engine now supports the original SQL files with:
- ✅ Native `ENUM` type support
- ✅ Native `DATE` type support  
- ✅ `UNIQUE` constraint support
- ✅ `ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` support
- ✅ `FOREIGN KEY` constraints with full referential integrity
- ✅ `GROUP BY` clause support with aggregate functions

## Testing
All features have been thoroughly tested with:
- Unit-style feature tests in `enhanced_features_demo.go`
- Real-world schema testing with original SQL files
- Error condition testing (duplicate values, invalid enums, etc.)
- Integration testing with existing Mist features

## Usage Examples

```sql
-- Complete table with all new features including foreign keys
CREATE TABLE companies (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE departments (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INT NOT NULL,
    department_id INT, -- nullable for SET NULL action
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    full_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    birth_date DATE,
    status ENUM('active', 'inactive', 'suspended') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    status_id INT DEFAULT 1, -- has default value for SET DEFAULT action
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (status_id) REFERENCES task_statuses(id) ON DELETE SET DEFAULT
);

-- All the following operations now work correctly:
INSERT INTO companies (name) VALUES ('Tech Corp');
INSERT INTO departments (company_id, name) VALUES (1, 'Engineering');
INSERT INTO user_profiles (company_id, department_id, email, username, full_name, birth_date, status) 
VALUES (1, 1, 'user@example.com', 'username', 'Full Name', '1990-01-01', 'active');
INSERT INTO tasks (user_id, title, status_id) VALUES (1, 'Important Task', 2);

UPDATE user_profiles SET full_name = 'Updated Name' WHERE id = 1;
-- ^ This will automatically update the updated_at timestamp

-- GROUP BY queries with aggregates work:
SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count FROM user_profiles GROUP BY status;

-- Foreign key actions work correctly:
-- CASCADE: Deleting a company will cascade delete departments and users
DELETE FROM companies WHERE id = 1; -- Cascades to departments, then to users, then to tasks

-- SET NULL: Deleting a department sets user department_id to NULL
DELETE FROM departments WHERE id = 1; -- Sets user_profiles.department_id to NULL

-- SET DEFAULT: Deleting a task status sets tasks to default status
DELETE FROM task_statuses WHERE id = 2; -- Sets tasks.status_id to default value (1)

-- Foreign key constraint violations are prevented:
-- This will fail due to invalid company_id:
INSERT INTO user_profiles (company_id, email, username, full_name) 
VALUES (999, 'user2@example.com', 'user2', 'User Two');

-- This will fail due to foreign key constraint (RESTRICT):
DELETE FROM companies WHERE id = 1; -- Only if ON DELETE RESTRICT

-- This will fail due to unique constraint:
INSERT INTO user_profiles (company_id, email, username, full_name) 
VALUES (1, 'user@example.com', 'different_username', 'Another User');

-- This will fail due to invalid enum value:
INSERT INTO user_profiles (company_id, email, username, full_name, status) 
VALUES (1, 'new@example.com', 'newuser', 'New User', 'invalid_status');
```

## Future Enhancements
While significant progress has been made, the following features could be added in the future:
- **ON UPDATE** foreign key actions (CASCADE, SET NULL, SET DEFAULT for updates)
- `CHECK` constraints
- More complex date/time functions
- Additional SQL data types (JSON, BLOB, etc.)
- Index optimization for unique constraints
- Composite primary keys
- Advanced JOIN optimizations
- Transaction support with rollback capabilities
